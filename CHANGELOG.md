# Python JSONPath Change Log

## Version 0.10.1

**Hot fix**

- Fixed priority of JSONPath lexer rules. Previously, standard short tokens (like `*` and `?`) had a higher priority than environment-controlled tokens (like `JSONPathEnvironment.keys_selector_token`), making it impossible to incorporate short token characters into longer environment-controlled tokens.

## Version 0.10.0

**Breaking Changes**

- We now enforce JSONPath filter expression "well-typedness" by default. That is, filter expressions are checked at compile time according to the [IETF JSONPath Draft function extension type system](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-jsonpath-base-21#section-2.4.1) and rules regarding non-singular query usage. If an expression is deemed to not be well-typed, a `JSONPathTypeError` is raised. This can be disabled in Python JSONPath by setting the `well_typed` argument to `JSONPathEnvironment` to `False`, or using `--no-type-checks` on the command line. See [#33](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/issues/33).
- The JSONPath lexer and parser have been refactored to accommodate [#30](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/issues/30). As a result, the tokens generated by the lexer and the ATS built by the parser have changed significantly. In the unlikely event that anyone is customizing the lexer or parser through subclassing, please [open an issue](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/issues) and I'll provide more details.
- Changed the normalized representation of JSONPath string literals to use double quotes instead of single quotes.
- Changed the normalized representation of JSONPath filter expressions to not include parentheses unless the expression includes one or more logical operators.
- The built-in implementation of the standard `length()` filter function is now a class and is renamed to `jsonpath.function_extensions.Length`.
- The built-in implementation of the standard `value()` filter function is now a class and is renamed to `jsonpath.function_extensions.Value`.

**Fixes**

- We no longer silently ignore invalid escape sequences in JSONPath string literals. For example, `$['\"']` used to be OK, it now raises a `JSONPathSyntaxError`. See [#31](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/issues/31).
- Fixed parsing of JSONPath integer literals that use scientific notation. Previously we raised a `JSONPathSyntaxError` for literals such as `1e2`.
- Fixed parsing of JSONPath comparison and logical expressions as filter function arguments. Previously we raised a `JSONPathSyntaxError` if a comparison or logical expression appeared as a filter function argument. Note that none of the built-in, standard filter functions accept arguments of `LogicalType`.
- Fixed parsing of nested JSONPath filter functions, where a function is used as an argument to another.
- Fixed JSONPath bracketed segments. We now handle an arbitrary number of filter selectors alongside name, index, slice and wildcard selectors, separated by commas. See [#30](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/issues/30).

## Version 0.9.0

**Breaking Changes**

- `CompoundJSONPath` instances are no longer updated in-place when using `.union()` and `.intersection()`. Instead, a new `CompoundJSONPath` is returned. `CompoundJSONPath.paths` is now a tuple instead of a list.

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug with the parsing of JSON Pointers. When given an arbitrary string without slashes, `JSONPointer` would resolve to the document root. The empty string is the only valid pointer that should resolve to the document root. We now raise a `JSONPointerError` in such cases. See [#27](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/issues/27).
- Fixed handling of JSON documents containing only a top-level string.

**Features**

- Added a command line interface, exposing JSONPath, JSON Pointer and JSON Patch features ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/cli/), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/blob/main/jsonpath/cli.py)).
- Added `JSONPointer.parent()`, a method that returns the parent of the pointer, as a new `JSONPointer` ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/pointers/#parent)).
- Implemented `JSONPointer.__truediv__()` to allow creation of child pointers from an existing pointer using the slash (`/`) operator ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/pointers/#slash-operator)).
- Added `JSONPointer.join()`, a method for creating child pointers. This is equivalent to using the slash (`/`) operator for each argument given to `join()` ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/pointers/#joinparts)).
- Added `JSONPointer.exists()`, a method that returns `True` if a the pointer can be resolved against some data, or `False` otherwise ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/pointers/#existsdata)).
- Added the `RelativeJSONPointer` class for building new `JSONPointer` instances from Relative JSON Pointer syntax ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/pointers/#torel), [API](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/api/#jsonpath.RelativeJSONPointer)).
- Added support for a non-standard index/property pointer using `#<property or index>`. This is to support Relative JSON Pointer's use of hash (`#`) when building `JSONPointer` instances from relative JSON Pointers.
- Added the `unicode_escape` argument to `JSONPathEnvironment`. When `True` (the default), UTF-16 escaped sequences found in JSONPath string literals will be decoded.

## Version 0.8.1

**Fixes**

- Fixed the string representation of a `JSONPointer` when built using `JSONPointer.from_parts()` and pointing to the document root. See [#21](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/issues/21).

## Version 0.8.0

**Breaking changes**

- Changed the `JSONPathMatch.parts` representation of the non-standard _keys_ selector (default `~`) to be `~` followed by the key name. It used to be two "parts", `~` and key index.
- All `FilterExpression` subclasses must now implement `children()` and `set_children()`. These methods facilitate filter expression inspection and caching.

**Fixes**

- Changed `findall()` and `finditer()` to accept `data` arguments of any `io.IOBase` subclass, not just `TextIO`.

**Features**

- Added the `JSONPointer` class and methods for converting a `JSONPathMatch` to a `JSONPointer`. `JSONPointer` is compliant with [RFC 6901](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6901) ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/api/#jsonpath.JSONPointer)).
- Added the `JSONPatch` class. `JSONPatch` implements [RFC 6902](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/api/#jsonpath.JSONPatch)).
- Added `jsonpath.pointer.resolve()`, a convenience function for resolving a JSON Pointer ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/quickstart/#pointerresolvepointer-data)).
- Added `jsonpath.patch.apply()`, a convenience function for applying a JSON Patch ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/quickstart/#patchapplypatch-data)).
- Added `jsonpath.match()`, a convenience function returning a `JSONPathMatch` instance for the first match of a path, or `None` if there were no matches ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/quickstart/#matchpath-data)).
- Added filter expression caching. Controlled with the `filter_caching` argument to `JSONPathEnvironment`, filter expression caching is enabled by default. See [#14]
- All selectors now use `env.match_class` to instantiate new `JSONPathMatch` objects. This allows for subclassing of `JSONPathMatch`.
- Added `jsonpath.filter.walk()` for the benefit of filter expression static analysis.

## Version 0.7.1

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug with the filter context selector (default `_`) when it's used as a filter function argument.

## Version 0.7.0

**Breaking changes**

- `JSONPathIndexError` now requires a `token` parameter. It used to be optional.
- Filter expressions that resolve JSON paths (like `SelfPath` and `RootPath`) now return a `NodeList`. The node list must then be explicitly unpacked by `JSONPathEnvironment.compare()` and any filter function that has a `with_node_lists` attribute set to `True`. This is done for the benefit of the `count()` filter function and standards compliance.

**Features**

- `missing` is now an allowed alias of `undefined` when using the `isinstance()` filter function.

**IETF JSONPath Draft compliance**

- The built-in `count()` filter function is now compliant with the standard, operating on a "nodelist" instead of node values.

## Version 0.6.0

**Breaking changes**

- The "extra filter context" identifier now defaults to `_`. Previously it defaulted to `#`, but it has been decided that `#` is better suited as a current key/property or index identifier.

**Features**

- Added a non-standard keys/properties selector ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/syntax/#keys-or), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/blob/main/jsonpath/selectors.py#L193)).
- Added a non-standard `typeof()` filter function. `type()` is an alias for `typeof()` ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/functions/#typeof), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/blob/main/jsonpath/function_extensions/typeof.py)).
- Added a non-standard `isinstance()` filter function. `is()` is an alias for `isinstance()` ([docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/functions/#isinstance), [source](https://github.com/jg-rp/python-jsonpath/blob/main/jsonpath/function_extensions/is_instance.py)).
- Added a current key/property or index identifier. When filtering a mapping, `#` will hold key associated with the current node (`@`). When filtering a sequence, `#` will hold the current index. See [docs](https://jg-rp.github.io/python-jsonpath/syntax/#filters-expression).

**IETF JSONPath Draft compliance**

- Don't allow leading zeros in index selectors. We now raise a `JSONPathSyntaxError`.
- Validate the built-in `count()` function's argument is array-like.

## Version 0.5.0

**Features**

- Added the built-in `match` filter function.
- Added the built-in `search` filter function.
- Added the built-in `value` filter function.
- Pass the current environment to filter function validation.
- Added support for the wildcard selector in selector segment lists.

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug where the current object identifier (`@`) would evaluate to `undefined` when a filter is applied to an array of strings.
- Compound paths that have a trailing `|` or `&` now raise a `JSONPathSyntaxError`.

**IETF JSONPath Draft compliance**

- Removed support for dotted index selectors.
- Raise a `JSONPathSyntaxError` for unescaped whitespace and control characters.
- Raise a `JSONPathSyntaxError` for empty selector segments.
- Raise a `JSONPathIndexError` if an index selector is out of range.
- Raise a `JSONPathSyntaxError` for too many colons in a slice selector.
- Raise a `JSONPathIndexError` if a slice selector argument is out of range.
- Allow nested filters.

## Version 0.4.0

**IETF JSONPath Draft compliance**

- **Behavioral change.** When applied to a JSON object, filters now have an implicit preceding wildcard selector and the "current" (`@`) object is set to each of the object's values. This is now consistent with applying filters to arrays and adheres to the IETF JSONPath Internet Draft.

## Version 0.3.0

**IETF JSONPath Draft compliance**

- Added support for function extensions.
- Added the built-in `length()` function.
- Added the built-in `count()` function. `count()` is an alias for `length()`.
- Support filters without parentheses.
- Adhere to IETF JSONPath draft escaping in quoted property selectors.
- Handle UTF-16 surrogate pairs in quoted property selectors.

**Features**

- Added the built-in `keys()` function.
- Added `parent` and `children` properties to `JSONPathMatch`. Now we can traverse the "document tree" after finding matches.
- Added a `parts` property to `JSONPathMatch`. `parts` is a tuple of `int`s, `slice`s and `str`s that can be used with `JSONPathEnvironment.getitem()` to get the matched object from the original data structure, or equivalent data structures. It is the keys, indices and slices that make up a concrete path.

## Version 0.2.0

**Fixes**

- Fixed a bug with `CompoundJSONPath.finditer()` and the intersection operator (`&`). The intersection operation was returning just the left hand results.

## Version 0.1.0
